#HandCricket
#Rules:First, between you and the computer, you have to decide who is batting and balling by a toss
#The computer and you, the user are required to simultaneously enter a number.
#If the numbers are the same, whoever is batting is out
#If the numbers are not the same, whoever is batting will add that many runs to his score
#Whoever scores more wins
